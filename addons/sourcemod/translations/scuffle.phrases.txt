"Phrases" {

    // Your help is appreciated at translating the few phrases found here into
    // your native language. Scuffle does not accept multiple translations in a
    // single file (you're free to do it, but don't ask for it to be accepted).
    //
    // Scuffle follows a multi-file translation setup and it's pretty simple to
    // get started. The following GETTING STARTED should walk you through it.
    //
    // GETTING STARTED
    // 1. Check .../left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/configs/languages.cfg
    // 2. Find your ISO language code e.g., ro, ar (referenced later as $ISOCODE)
    // 3. Copy scuffle.phrases.txt into .../left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/translations/$ISOCODE
    // 4. Edit the file and replace all the "en" keys with "$ISOCODE" e.g, es, ro, ar
    // 5. Edit the values associated with "$ISOCODE" into your native language
    // 6. Restart the server or use "changelevel" to load up the translations
    // 7. To test in another language, change cvar cl_language and repeat step 6
    // 8. Share it on https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=303635
    //
    // NOT SURE HOW TO TRANSLATE SOMETHING EXACTLY?
    // No need to be perfect. Translate it to the best of your ability and just
    // try to get the point across as succinctly as possible. Thanks!
    //
    // EXAMPLE
    // 1. See .../left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/translations/es/scuffle.phrases.txt
    // 2. You don't have to understand it, but notice "en" changed to "es"
    // 3. Notice the values related to each "es" have changed.
    //
    // When in doubt, see the following
